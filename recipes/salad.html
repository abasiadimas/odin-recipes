    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Greek salad, known as "<strong>Horiatiki</strong>" in Greece, is a classic
      Mediterranean dish that captures the essence of fresh, vibrant flavors. It
      typically consists of ripe tomatoes, crisp cucumbers, green bell peppers,
      red onions, Kalamata olives, and creamy feta cheese, all drizzled with
      extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of oregano. The salad is refreshing
      and light, often served as a side dish or starter, and embodies the
      simplicity and healthiness of Greek cuisine. It's a perfect balance of
      salty, tangy, and crunchy elements, making it a favorite in both Greek and
      international kitchens.
