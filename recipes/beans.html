    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Greek bean soup, or "<strong>Fasolada</strong>," is a classic and
      comforting dish deeply rooted in Greek tradition. This hearty soup is made
      with tender white beans simmered with tomatoes, onions, carrots, and
      celery, all infused with olive oil and aromatic herbs. It's a nutritious
      and filling meal that embodies the simplicity and warmth of Mediterranean
      cuisine. Fasolada is often enjoyed as a main dish, served with crusty
      bread and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, making it a perfect choice
      for a cozy, wholesome meal.
